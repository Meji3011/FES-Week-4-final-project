WEEK 4 Final Project - Anime search

There are a few things that I would like to add to the final project, but in it's current state it has a few functions already implemeneted, such as displaying current season anime and top anime. The search function is working really well and I'm happy about it.

However, there are a few functions that I'd like to implement, one of which is having multiple pages to go through instead of only being able to display 12 anime on the page, I know I haven't learned the required knowledge for it yet so I'm waiting till I learn about it.

I also would like to add a sorting function, but the API does not have one built in it seems. I'm writing a js function to sort the anime by score, but am still in the process of implementing (as of 2/28/24). Once I figure out how to sort by score, I can do the other ones as well, such as alphabetical sorting and sort by year. Another function I want to implement is to show anime by year, which requires me to write a function that removes all anime that are not in the year I'm looking for. I have a pretty good idea on how to implement this, but it'll also take some time to figure out.

Hopefully this is a good start for using JS, I felt like I learned a lot about how to access smaller scale APIs and manipulate the data given to me. Cheers!
